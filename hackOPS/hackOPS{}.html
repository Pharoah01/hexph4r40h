        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center">Behind The Scenes</h2>
        <p>Myself and my peers got a chance to host a Capture The Flag event organized by Sathyabama IE(I) Student Chapter. It was a wonderful experience, as this was the first event we hosted in two years of college life. We sincerely thank Sathyabama IE(I) Student Chapter for this opportunity.</p> 
        <p>On March 19, 2025 (Wednesday), We hosted the CTF event. More than 20 teams (2 per team) have participated in the event and that was a great response from the participants, as we also seen there were students that hackOPS CTF was their first CTF event.</p>
        <p>After days of preparation, we have successfully hosted hackOPS, Capture The Flag {CTF} event! The event was an exciting blend of cybersecurity challenges, teamwork, and problem solving, giving participants hands-on experience in the world of ethical hacking.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Preparation & Setup</h2>
        <p>Myself started setting up a CTFd platform hosted on AWS, making sure everything was stable and accessible to all participants. We customized the platform using the pixo theme to enhance the user experience and give it a modern and professional look.</p>
        <p>But the real work lay in designing challenges. We created a diverse set of problems inspired by popular competitions but with our own twist and hindrance. Flag Format, hackOPS, became the signature of the event!</p>
